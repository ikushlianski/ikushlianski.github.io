An animated slider that switches slides every couple of seconds. A custom preloader looks neat!

#### Full-width images
At that time jQuery was still a thing and here I show how to make full-bleed images.

#### My first MVC attempt
From this example I learned about MVC concept and implemented a simple version of it, of course with cats!
